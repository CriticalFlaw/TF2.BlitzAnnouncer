# TF2Blitz-Announcer
Replaces the Team Fortress 2 announcer with the commentator from NFL Blitz 2001, developed by Midway Games for the Sega Dreamcast.

### Installation:
Download the VPK [here](https://github.com/CriticalFlaw/TF2Blitz-Announcer/releases) and put in your `tf/custom` folder. Please note that voice lines for Mann vs. Machine, Special Delivery and Robot Destruction have not yet been made so they will still use the default announcer.
